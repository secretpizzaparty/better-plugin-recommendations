There are so many plugins out there. Knowing which ones to choose can be really hard. Let us help.

== Description ==

With over 49,000 plugins in the repo it can be hard for new users to know where to start. Yeah there is search but what if you don’t know what you are looking for. What Better Plugin Recommendations does is remove the default featured and recommendations tab and instead adds a new recommendations tab which only included plugins that I've hand selected. These are plugins that I feel are appropriate for every new user and are ones that are great examples of why WordPress is awesome.

The only purpose of this plugin is to help WordPress users find the plugins they need. There is no branding or ads. It’s integrated perfectly into the Plugin -> New screen.

Saying that these are the "best" WordPress plugins isn't really helpful. Best is so subjective. I thought it would help if you knew the criteria I used in selecting these plugins, so I've included it below. I'm also trying to only include plugins that I think the majority of people will use. There are definitely some great niche plugins that I think are wonderful but not useful enough for everyone to include.

Here is the criteria I used:

Price (Free)
Numbers of users
Average Rating
Last Updated
Support Given

This plugin uses a web service to serve up the plugin results. The service is located at https://better-plugin-recommendations.now.sh

== Screenshots ==
1. It looks and acts exactly like the default "Recommended" tab (just with better recommendations).
